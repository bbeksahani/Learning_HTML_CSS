            Although technology has many positive benefits, it also brings with it a number of negative effects that
            need to be considered. A major concern is the erosion of privacy and increased surveillance facilitated by
            technology. From data breaches to monitoring of online activities, individuals are at risk of privacy
            breaches. While the rise of automation increases productivity, it also threatens employment in some
            industries, leading to job losses and economic inequality. Additionally, the prevalence of misinformation
            and the ease with which fake news spreads on digital platforms creates social problems that undermine trust
            and influence public debate. Technology is another issue, especially among young people, with too much
            screen time and digital addiction affecting mental health. Environmental impacts such as e-waste and the
            carbon footprint of data centers highlight the ecological costs of our digital lives. In addition, the
            digital divide increases social inequalities and makes it harder for communities to access education and
            financial opportunities. Addressing these negativities as we embrace technology is important to ensure
            balance and integration of technology in our lives.
